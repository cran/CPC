Description: Implements cluster-polarization coefficient for measuring distributional
	polarization in single or multiple dimensions, as well as associated functions.
	Contains support for hierarchical clustering, k-means, partitioning around medoids,
	density-based spatial clustering with noise, and manually imposed cluster membership.
